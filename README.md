# Habitual UI

[Habitual UI](https://www.figma.com/file/H9ZI5RYFA9qisxZBsOKx5J/Habitual?node-id=97%3A4027&t=399K3vxs1new52E5-1) is a user-friendly interface for a general e-commerce mobile application. It encompasses all core functionalities that an e-commerce mobile application should have, including:

- Onboarding page - welcomes users to the store and presents them with benefits of shopping in the app.
- Registration page - registers users and allows them to personalize their profiles by adding a profile picture, goals, and interests (with the option to skip any step).
- Home page - showcases products, categorized into "Just for you", "Deals", and "My Interests" sections for an effortless shopping experience.
- Product page - displays product's details, including a description, options (e.g., color), and reviews from other users.
- Wishlist page - keeps track of user's favorite products and group them into categories.
- Profile page - allows users to customize their personal information, including interests and profile picture.
- Cart page - displays the products that users have added to their cart and allows them to manage it.
- Order page - shows products that users have ordered with order status and delivery information.
- Search page - allows users to easily search for specific products they are looking.

## Tech Stack

Habitual UI is developed exclusively using **Figma**, a powerful design tool that allows for seamless collaboration between designers and developers. The design and prototype of Habitual UI can be viewed at [Habitual UI](https://www.figma.com/file/H9ZI5RYFA9qisxZBsOKx5J/Habitual?node-id=97%3A4027&t=399K3vxs1new52E5-1) and [Habitual prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/H9ZI5RYFA9qisxZBsOKx5J/Habitual?page-id=97%3A4028&node-id=100%3A9739&viewport=308%2C314%2C0.04&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=100%3A9739&show-proto-sidebar=1), respectively.

## Acknowledgment

I would like to express my gratitude to Andrei Neagoie and Daniel Schifano, the instructors of the [Complete Web & Mobile Designer in 2023: UI/UX, Figma, +more](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-web-designer-mobile-designer-zero-to-mastery) course on Udemy, for providing me with valuable knowledge and skills in developing this project.

For verification, my certificate of completion for the course is available at https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-24a91a37-5f9e-419e-ab88-ab5e8c587455.

## Roadmap

My future plan for this project is to bring it to life by developing a mobile application (possibly by using React Native or Kotlin) based on the user interface presented in this project.
